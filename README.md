## Overview

This video marks the fifth installment of the WPF tutorial series, starting with ThemeSwitch. We've mainly covered content derived from ContentControl and ItemsControl such as Buttons, Sliders, and ListBoxes. However, this time we delve into more complex functionalities like those in a DatePicker. Therefore, this series will be more challenging than previous ones.

But there's no need to worry. This tutorial video is prepared with care to ensure you can learn through repetition, with all processes, contents, and explanations arranged in an orderly fashion. Just repeat until you become familiar and proficient.
